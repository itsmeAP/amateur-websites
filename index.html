     <h1> Welcome to my travel blog!</h1>



     <p> So, thanks for taking the time to look at my blog first of all. Assuming you've heard of a travel blog before, this is kind of different. When I think of a travel blog, I think of a lot of beautiful pictures of landscape, people on boats, eating homeade pasta from Italy. Don't get me wrong, you'll see that, but my blog provides a twist. I will also be going to places that might not be as picturesque, with disgusting food, and i'll give you my <strong> raw </strong> reaction. Stay tuned...</p>

     <p id="aboutme"> My name is Amelia Parham. I am from Quincy, MA and I am a renouned traveller. I have a few shows, one of them being <i>The world is your oyester</i> on the food network in which I travel the world eating different types of seafood. When I was young I loved looking at landscapes, eating fancy foods, etc. I wasn't rich or anything, though, I just really wanted to eat fancy foods, be at those landscapes instead of just looking at them. Fast forward to college, I got an internship that paid a lot of money (I studied business). I had a co-op in the same year in which me and my colleagues travelled to Gothenburg, Sweden. It was then that I was able to fully experience travel and I fell in love with it. The people, the landscape, the food. With the money that I had I took a semester off to "study" and by that I mean travel everywhere I could without going completely broke. It was amazing. I went to Stockholm, Copenhagen, San Francisco, and somewhere in Finland. They were the cheapest destinations but I still managed to go practically broke. My point is, it was amazing and I would've never known what it was like to go there if I didn't take the initiative to dream. Sounds cheesy? That's because it is, and I totally didn't steal that from a Disney movie. But hey, I thought about it, I was hoping to travel and now I have.

     <h3> What happened to me in Finland </h3>
     <p id="finland"> As you all probably know, I slept over at an abandonned house of an old couple who died in there. I was not ok. I didn't go alone, of course, but still. Why did I do this? It was suggested by one of you, so thank your peers for my near death experience. Anyways, we were supposed to get a rent-a-car, and we ordered one two weeks ago, but somehow they didn't get the memo. When we finally got it though, it was at 7pm, and it was a <i>two</i> hour drive, minus the traffic and the intense gas stop. Everything in Finland is expensive, I hear. But I realized too late because the gas was $12. If gas was that much, I can't imagine the food prices. We had an arguement with the employee but he responded "we cannot afford less". Ok but us tourists can't afford more. So, plus the
